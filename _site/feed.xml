        <title>Theatre</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Theater combines real people artfully presenting dialog. This combined with creative stage settings are powerful. You can learn to make better product presentations and pitches for funding of projects. I have learned that combining the theatrical arts with retail you can create trade show booths that are unique and make you more noticeable and memorable to customers. Add music and you ad even more power to you presentation or commercial.  Remember, you idea, product, selling proposition has to be repeated three times to get into the minds you want to get into.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Art</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artists have a unique way of seeing the world and living in it. I visit museums and marvel at all types of art from painting to sculpture as well as video and music. You never know what creative ideas your mind will generate just from looking at things through an artistâ€™s eyes and ears. Also take a good look at how they create their art. It may spur an idea on a better way to make something. Sometimes overlooked as an art form are retail window displays and product presentations in the store. I marvel at them and let the creativity plan seeds of future ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
