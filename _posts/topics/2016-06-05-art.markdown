<h4>Art Innovation</h4>
Artists have a unique way of seeing the world and living in it. I visit museums and marvel at all types of art from painting to sculpture as well as video and music. You never know what creative ideas your mind will generate just from looking at things through an artistâ€™s eyes and ears. Also take a good look at how they create their art. It may spur an idea on a better way to make something. Sometimes overlooked as an art form are retail window displays and product presentations in the store. I marvel at them and let the creativity plan seeds of future ideas.
