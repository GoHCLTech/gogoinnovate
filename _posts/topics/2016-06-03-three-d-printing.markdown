3D printing has revolutionized the innovation process since the first SLA machine was sold by 3D Systems in the late 1980’s. Since then it has evolved into several different modalities with many different players in the market.  The top two professional grade printing companies are 3D Systems and Stratasys.  Both have a relatively large install base in most of the major corporations in the US. The technologies that exist today are Steriolithography (SLA), Digital Light Processing (DLP), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electronic Beam Melting (EBM), and Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM).
 
All of the above technologies work based on the principle of layer slice.  A 3D solid model is broken down into the layers that define the model in a given cross-section.  The printer will reproduce the layers until you end up with the completed part.  There are many factors that go into the production of a good part for your specific application.  For example, build orientation is key to part strength.  If you build a shaft down the round cross-section it will be more accurate than building it perpendicular to the cross-section (which looks like a rectangle), however, not as strong.  There are many material options that closely simulate the performance of actual molded or cast parts. It all comes down to the specific application for your part.  
 
The type of technology you choose depends a lot on what you plan to do with the end prototype and the amount of money you want to spend.  Technology such as FDM can produce very strong parts that are perfect for proof-of-concept or even end-use models.  The trade off with FDM is the aesthetic appeal of the part.  SLA is a better option if surface finish is important.  However, even with SLA a certain amount of post-processing will be necessary if your end goal is a perfect looking part.  With that being said FDM is significantly cheaper than SLA.  So there are trade-offs that must be considered with the different technologies.
 
No matter what modality you choose 3D Printing is a game changer in getting to market quicker with a better end product.  It’s hard to imagine the challenges that folks like Henry Ford must have endured in product development.  We now have the luxury of trying many iterations of a part without making tools or machining large billets of aluminum to ultimately determine a change must be made.
